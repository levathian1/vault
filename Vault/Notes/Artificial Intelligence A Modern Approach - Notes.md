Goal of Artificial Intelligence = to build / create intelligent entities, emulating humans

Turing test: gives a basis for evaluating intelligence, through a series of questions if the examiner cannot tell if the being is a machine or human it passes

Allen Newell, Herbert Simon 1961- General Problem Solver (GPS)

Cognitive science allows us to bring tohether computer models and psychology to build precise and testable theories of the human mind
	_We can therefore build a representation of the inner working of human intelligence within a machine

Wilson and Keil 1999: encyclopedia on cognitive science

syllogisms are patterns for argument structures that always provide correct conclusions when given correct premises => logic

The skills needed for the Turing test means a being that possesses them is capable of rational thinking

Limitations: Perfect rationality (always doing the right thing) is not always possible within the confines of the subject, because of limited ressources at our disposal
